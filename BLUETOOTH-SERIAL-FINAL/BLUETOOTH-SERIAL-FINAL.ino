/*
The posible baudrates are:
1-------1200
2-------2400
3------4800
4------9600
5------19200
6-------38400
7------57600
8-----115200
9------230400
A-----460800
B-----921600
C-----1382400


*** Important. If you re-set the BT baud rate, you must change the myserial baud to match what was just set. Steps:

Assuming the BT module baud default is 9600 Baud set mySerial to 9600 and you want to change it to 57600.
1) leave the line:  //mySerial.begin(9600); as you have to been at the current baud setting to be able to send the command to the BT module.
2) uncomment the line:  //mySerial.print("AT+BAUD7"); // Set baudrate to 57600
3) run the sketch.  This will set the baud to 57600.  However, you may not see the response OK. 
4) uncomment the line //mySerial.begin(57600); and download the sketch again - this sets myserial to the new setting.
5) now that myserial is set to 57600 open the serial monitor - this will restart the sketch.  You should see a secomd line after "Goodnight Moon"
that will show the BT module responding to the change.
6) be sure to re-comment the line //mySerial.print("AT+BAUD7"); when done
