Now that youâ€™ve got the basics, make a musical instrument. Consider a few things in designing your instrument:

Do you want to play discrete notes (like a piano), or sliding pitches (like a theremin)? How do you program to achieve these effects?
Do you want to control the tempo and duration of a note?
Do you want the same physical action to set both the pitch and the velocity (volume) of a note?
Do you want to be able to play more than one note at a time (e.g. chords)?
All of these questions, and many more, will affect what sensors you use, how you read them, and how you design both the physical interface and the software.
